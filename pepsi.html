        <p>Pepsi was first introduced as "Brad's Drink" in New Bern, North Carolina in 1893 by Caleb Bradham, who made it at his drugstore where the drink was sold.
            It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, "Pepsi" because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (indigestion) and "Cola" referring to the cola flavor. Some have
            also suggested that "Pepsi" may have been a reference to the drink aiding digestion like the digestive enzyme pepsin, but pepsin itself was never 
            used as an ingredient to Pepsi-Cola.</p>
            
        <p>The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.</p>

        <h4 id="PepsiSports">Sports Sponsorships</h4>
        <p>Pepsi has official sponsorship deals with the National Football League, National Hockey League, and National Basketball Association. 
            It was the sponsor of Major League Soccer until December 2015 and Major League Baseball until April 2017, both leagues signing deals
            with Coca-Cola. From 1999 to 2020, Pepsi also had the naming rights to the Pepsi Center, an indoor sports and entertainment
            facility in Denver, Colorado, until the venue's new naming rights were announced on October 22, 2020. In 1997, after his sponsorship
            with Coca-Cola ended, retired NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver turned Fox NASCAR announcer Jeff Gordon signed a long-term contract with Pepsi,
            and he drives with the Pepsi logos on his car with various paint schemes for about 2 races each year, usually a darker paint scheme during
            nighttime races. Pepsi has remained as one of his sponsors ever since. Pepsi has also sponsored the NFL Rookie of the Year award since 2002.</p>

        <p>Pepsi has the first global sponsorship deals with the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women's Champions League starting in the 2015 - 16 season
            along with the sister brand, Pepsi Max and became the global sponsor of the competition.</p>
            
        <p>Pepsi also has sponsorship deals in international cricket teams. The Pakistani national cricket team is one of the teams that the brand sponsors.
            The team wears the Pepsi logo on the front of their test and ODI test match clothing.</p>    
            
        <p>The Buffalo Bisons, an American Hockey League team, was sponsored by Pepsi-Cola in its later years; the team adopted the beverage's red, white,
            and blue color scheme along with a modification of the Pepsi logo (with the word "Buffalo" in place of the Pepsi-Cola wordmark). The Bisons ceased
            operations in 1970, making way for the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL.</p>
            
        <p>Pepsi also has been a sponsor of the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League since the team moved to North Carolina in 1997.</p>
            
        <p>In 2017, Pepsi was the jersey sponsor of the Papua New Guinea national basketball team.</p>
