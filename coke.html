        <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. Originally
            marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late
            19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold Coca-Cola's
            ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola
            to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.
            The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).
            The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a closely guarded trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes
            and experimental recreations have been published. The secrecy around the formula has been used by Coca-Cola in its
            marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula. The drink has inspired imitators and created
            a whole classification of soft drink: colas.</p>

        <p>The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. 
            The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles
            sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world. 
            The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.</p>
            
        <p>The Coca-Cola Company has on occasion introduced other cola drinks under the Coke name. The most common of these
            is Diet Coke, along with others including Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola, Diet Coke Caffeine-Free, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola
            Cherry, Coca-Cola Vanilla, and special versions with lemon, lime, and coffee. Coca-Cola was called Coca-Cola Classic from
            July 1985 to 2009, to distinguish it from "New Coke". Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of 2020, Coca-Cola
            was the world's sixth most valuable brand. In 2013, Coke products were sold in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers
            drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each day. Coca-Cola ranked No. 87 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of
            the largest United States corporations by total revenue.</p>

        <h4 id="CocaColaSports">Sport Sponsorships</h4>
        <p>Coca-Cola was the first commercial sponsor of the Olympic Games, at the 1928 games in Amsterdam, and has been an Olympics
            sponsor ever since. This corporate sponsorship included the 1996 Summer Olympics hosted in Atlanta, which allowed
            Coca-Cola to spotlight its hometown. Most recently, Coca-Cola has released localized commercials for the 2010 Winter
            Olympics in Vancouver; one Canadian commercial referred to Canada's hockey heritage and was modified after Canada
            won the gold medal game on February 28, 2010, by changing the ending line of the commercial to say "Now they know
            whose game they're playing".</p>

        <p>Since 1978, Coca-Cola has sponsored the FIFA World Cup, and other competitions organized by FIFA. One FIFA
            tournament trophy, the FIFA World Youth Championship from Tunisia in 1977 to Malaysia in 1997, was called "FIFA
            Coca-Cola Cup". In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors NASCAR's annual Coca-Cola 600 and Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Charlotte
            Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina and Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida; since 2020, Coca-Cola
            has served as a premier partner of the NASCAR Cup Series, which includes holding the naming rights to the series' regular
            season championship trophy. Coca-Cola is also the sponsor of the iRacing Pro Series.</p>
            
        <p>Coca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included Major League Baseball,
            the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League, as well as with many
            teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, due in part
            to the now-famous 1979 television commercial featuring "Mean Joe" Greene, leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola
            Great Hall at Heinz Field in 2001 and a more recent Coca-Cola Zero commercial featuring Troy Polamalu.</p>
            
        <p>Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of many collegiate football teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola
            providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially
            prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.</p>    
            
        <p>Coca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the 1996 Cricket World Cup held on the Indian subcontinent. Coca-Cola is
            also one of the associate sponsors of Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League.</p>
            
        <p>In England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of The Football League between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three
            professional divisions below the Premier League in soccer (football). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition
            for the 72 clubs of The Football League – it was called "Win a Player". This allowed fans to place one vote per
            day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning £250,000 for the club; this was
            repeated in 2006. The "Win A Player" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions,
            Leeds United A.F.C. had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new
            player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to "Buy a Player". This competition allowed fans to buy
            a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code
            could then earn anything from 50p to £100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over
            the old "Win a Player" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money. Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola
            was the title sponsor of the Football League Cup (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.
            Starting in 2019 – 20 season, Drinks giant Coca-Cola has agreed its biggest UK sponsorship deal by becoming
            Premier League football's seventh and final commercial partner for the UK and Ireland, China, Malaysia,
            Indonesia, Singapore, Egyptian and the West African markets.</p>
            
        <p>Between 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the Scottish League Cup, renaming it to the Coca-Cola
            Cup like its English counterpart. From 1998 to 2001, the company was the title sponsor of the Irish League Cup in
            Northern Ireland, where it was named the Coca-Cola League Cup.</p>
            
        <p>Coca-Cola is the presenting sponsor of the Tour Championship, the final event of the PGA Tour held each year at East
            Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, GA.</p>
            
        <p>Coca-Cola which has been a partner with UEFA since 1988.</p>
